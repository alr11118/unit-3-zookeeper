    // animals have been instatiated


    // Create a getter/accessor method for returning the animal type

    // Create a getter/ accessor method for updating the animal type

    // Creat a speak() method that uses the animal type and returns
    // a sound based on the animal type. You can just return a String with the animal noise


    // Create the speakBackward() method that calls speak() and returns the reversed String


    // Create the toString() method which returns friendly description of the animal

    // Create a static method called "randomAnimalType" that returns a random
    // animale type
    // HINT: Decide how many animal types you want to be able to create, pick a random number
    // and then use if/else/if statements to determine what the animal should say
